Alison McCondichie - Homework 4 - Pandas Challenge 

Analysis for this homework challenge is here in the ReadMe and also in the notebook. 

This notebook takes a look at how different school factors can contribute to student success, as measured in passing scores. We ran through a few different functions to get a feel of the overall average metrics such as: school size, budget, and grades. Then we created DataFrames with different combinations of the metrics to get a broad summary of what stands out and what patterns there are in comparing student success to school metrics.

Conclusion 1 - All five of the top performing schools are Charter Schools, while all five of the lowest performing schools are District type. While school type is not THE direct causation for student success, it certainly has a strong correlation to student success. 

Conclusion 2 - The lowest performing school have a slightly larger per student budget than the highest performing schools, which through analysis, seems to be connected more to school size. To me, this shows that student budget doesn't correlate to student success as much as the amount of students does. In fact, the highest % of overall students passing connects to the lowest budget range. School size and school type seem to be the best indicators for students success. 

Smaller schools have higher passing rates and Charter schools have higher passing rates.
